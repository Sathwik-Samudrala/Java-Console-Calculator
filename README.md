# 🧮 Java Console Calculator

📟 A command-line calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions with proper operator precedence (PEMDAS), built as part of a Java developer internship task.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Full Operator Precedence**  
   - Correctly solves expressions like `5+3*2` = `11` (not `16`)  
✅ **Error Handling**  
   - Detects division by zero, invalid characters, and syntax errors  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface**  
   - Simple console input/output with clear prompts

## 🔍 Development Approach
### Learning Sources
- YouTube: Studied expression parsing algorithms  
- AI Tools: Used ChatGPT for debugging suggestions  
- Official Docs: Java `Scanner` and `Double.parseDouble()`  

### Personal Implementation
- Designed all calculation logic independently  
- Implemented custom error handling  
- Added test cases for edge scenarios
